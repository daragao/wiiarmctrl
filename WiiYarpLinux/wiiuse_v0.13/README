WHAT'S NEW?

- OSX support
- WiiMotionPlus support


ABOUT

    This realease of wiiuse is based on the release 0.12 with motion-plus
    support from the fWiine project. After reading the dolphin-emu source code
    and picking some ideas there, a new implementation has been written. The
    main entry file is io_osx.c that mimics io_win.c or io_nix.c.

    This release has been successfully tested with the sample test code under
    osx (10.5 and 10.6). There is also an "external" (a plugin) for the PureData
    music software. This external, which uses the wiiuse shared library, has
    been tested successfully both on osx and windows.

COMPILING

    OSX:
        You will find in this archive the source code with the xcode project,
        ready to compile. The project has 3 "targets":
            1- the wiiuse dynamic library itself;
            2- the test executable;
            3- the PureData external (also a dynamic library).

        At least you need to "build" the "wiiuse" target and put the resulting
        wiiuse.dylib file into /usr/local/lib
    
    Linux, Windows:
        see ./src/wiiuse_0.12/README
